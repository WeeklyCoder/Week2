# Week 2 | Morse Code
Get creative, create visuals, and reignite the excitement of this communication system from the early 19th century.

## 📃 Description:
_Morse Code played a vital role in World War II, introduced the SOS distress signal, facilitated the first transatlantic Telegraph message, and aided communication during the Titanic disaster._

## 👩‍⚖️ Rules:
Whether it be the classic text to Morse Code converter or something visual, auditory, +, this one's up to you.

## ✨ Variation:
Not everything has to be about mundane functionality. Experimentation suggestions: Music, Generative Art, Interaction, Typography, +.

## 💡 Where to start? (Ideas)
It’s always Input, Process, Output.
- Let you start by creating the classic Text to Morse converter. Open up **[Guide.txt](https://github.com/WeeklyCoder/Week2/blob/main/Guide.txt)** to get started.
- See how easily you could take in a Morse Code and convert it to human readable Text.

## 🥨 Twists
- It doesn't all have to be human input text. You could instead use poems, quotes, lyrics, + to see what their creative representation looks like in Morse Code.
- See how you can incorporate interactivity to the seemingly mundane '-', '.', and ' ' together with your Keyboard, Mouse, Time, Randomness, Events, Internet, Audio, +

## ⏳ Submissions:
- Submission of this challenge, just like all of the Weekly Coder’s challenges, is to be submitted within 36 hours after its post. And so, Sunday morning 12:00 LT.
